# Autonomous-Vehicle-Perception-Object-Detection
This project aims to create a robust object detection system inspired by Faster R-CNN. It encompasses the creation of a custom object detection model and the implementation of essential components necessary for object detection, including feature extraction, anchor generation, and multiple networks
