# Autonomous-Vehicle-Perception-Object-Detection
This project aims to create a robust object detection system inspired by Faster R-CNN. It encompasses the creation of a custom object detection model and the implementation of essential components necessary for object detection, including feature extraction, anchor generation, and multiple networks

## Key Features

## Feature Extraction:

Feature extraction is the initial step in object detection, where the model processes an input image to extract meaningful and informative features.
These features represent various aspects of the image, such as edges, textures, and patterns, and are crucial for subsequent stages of object detection.

## Anchor Generation:

Anchor generation is a technique used in object detection models, particularly those based on the Region Proposal Network (RPN).
Anchors are predefined bounding boxes of different sizes and aspect ratios that are placed at various locations across the feature map.
These anchors serve as reference boxes that the RPN uses to propose potential object regions in the image

## Region Proposal Network:

RPNs are an integral part of two-stage object detection models like Faster R-CNN.
RPNs analyze the features extracted from the input image and generate a set of region proposals, which are candidate bounding boxes that may contain objects of interest.
These proposals are ranked based on their likelihood of containing objects, and the top candidates are passed to the subsequent stages for further processing

## Classification Network:

The classification network is a component of the two-stage object detection models that follows the RPN.
Its primary role is to classify the proposed regions (bounding boxes) generated by the RPN into different object categories (e.g., person, car, dog)
